This project aims examine the association between HRV and CVD risk in those who have prediabetes.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

The following folders contain:

- `data/`: Will contain the results from analyses.
- `data-raw/`: Contains the fake data to use to test out the code on.
- `doc/`: Contains the paper of the analysis.
- `R/`: Contains R code used for analysis. 

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`ADD_PRO_HRV_CVD.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("pak")
    pak::pak()

You'll need to have the pak package installed for this to work.
